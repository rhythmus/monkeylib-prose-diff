        <h2>Tokenization tests</h2>
        <p>Depending on how we split text into tokens when computing the LCS we can get slightly better or worse diffs. The remaining paragraphs in this section show some of the issues.</p>
        <p><span class="delete diff">Foo bar baz </span><span class="add diff">Quux biff boom </span>and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.</p>
        <p>One <span class="delete diff">foo bar baz </span><span class="add diff">quux biff boom </span>and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.</p>
        <p>Two <span class="delete diff">foo bar baz </span><span class="add diff">quux biff </span>and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.</p>
        <p>Three <span class="delete diff">foo bar baz </span><span class="add diff">quux biff boom blat </span>and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.</p>
        <p>Four I hope there's only one deletion and addition following: <span class="delete diff">foo bar baz</span><span class="add diff">quux biff boom</span></p>
        <p>Five I hope there's only one deletion and addition following: <span class="delete diff">foo bar baz </span><span class="add diff">quux biff boom </span>and stuff.</p>
        <p>A sentence that ends with foo<span class="add diff"> and bar</span>. Ideally foo will not be struck out in the diff.</p>
        <p>A sentence that ends with <span class="add diff">"</span>foo<span class="add diff">"</span>. Ideally the only diff will be the addition of quotes.</p>
        <div class="add diff">
